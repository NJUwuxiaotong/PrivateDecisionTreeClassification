# Private-DTC: PrivateDecisionTreeClassification

This project is for multiple decision tree classifiers and their private extended versions.

----------
Implemented Algorithms:
* C4.5 Decision Tree (C4_5) [1]
* Private C4.5 Decision Tree (PrivateC4_5_05P) [2]

----------
Test Dataset:
* Adult from UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu]. The dataset concludes 32560 records, 14 attributes and 2 class labels.
* Nursery from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset consists of 12959 records, 8 discrete attributes and 3 class labels.
